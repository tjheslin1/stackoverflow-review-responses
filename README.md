## Too much code

To help others understand your issue and to aid in finding a solution I would recommend you provide a [minimal, workable example (mwe)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of the issue you are facing. It's possible that the process of doing so sheds new light on the problem at hand. Regardless it will aid others in helping you. Please consider this when next posting a question, to aid in solving your future problems as quickly as possible. :)

## SuperUser

Since StackOverflow is focused on Questions/Answers directly related to coding issues, I would encourage you to post your question over at the [SuperUser StackExchange](https://superuser.com/).

or [AskUbuntu](https://askubuntu.com/).

## Code in screenshot

Please share any relevant code by editing your Question - [instead of a screenshot](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/285551/why-not-upload-images-of-code-errors-when-asking-a-question). Fewer people are likely to reproduce your issue without having your code in a copyable form.

## Code in link

Please share any relevant code in the Question, as a [minimal, workable example (mwe)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Not all users will click on links and therefore won't be able to help reproduce, and solve, your issue.

## Answered own question

Great work solving your own issue! You are [encouraged to answer your own question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/self-answer) so that it can serve as documentation for anyone else that has the same issue in the future. 48 hours  after posting you will be able to [accept your own answer](https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/01/06/accept-your-own-answers/).
